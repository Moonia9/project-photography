      <h2>Shadow and light through photography</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Light and shadow</strong> photography is using strong lights and shadows to create abstract or anonymous silhouettes. Especially in monochrome with the <em>high</em> contrast lighting, the images create unique perspectives. When you have <em>harsh</em> lights or <em>bright</em> light sources, you can create really great light and shadow images. Shadows can help to direct attention to a specific point in the composition. They can reveal form or hide features that may be better left unseen. They can also be used to add hint of drama, emotion, interest, or mystery to a photo. And of course, they can emphasize the light; drawing attention to highlights in an image.<br>
Some of the most used principles and the effects that the light and shadow can affect the photographed subjects are ones of the following:</p>

<ul>
        <li>Add Contrast</li><br>
        <li>Serve As a Focal Point</li><br>
        <li>Direct Attention</li><br>
        <li>Add Contrast</li><br>
        <li>Reveal Texture</li><br>
        <li>Emphasize Emotion</li><br>
        <li>Add Depth and Dimension</li><br>
        <li>Use Shadows to Create Color</li>

</ul>
      
  
      <h3>Movement</h3>
      
      <p>Perhaps the most obvious type of movement in photography, <strong>suspended <em>movement</em></strong> illustrates one of the camera’s most remarkable attributes: the ability to freeze a literal split second, to capture details imperceptible to the human eye. It’s the mid-action pause: hair flying, arms flailing, dust kicking, waves crashing. Get your subjects running, jumping, twirling, tossing, shaking, skipping, leaping. Great implied movement suggests the seconds that will follow the suspended moment, giving a viewer a strong sense of what would happen if the scene <em>“unpaused.”</em></p>
      
      <h4><strong>Visuals</strong></h4>
      
      <p>From mobile photography to virtual reality, the norms of <em>communication</em> are changing. We are becoming more accustomed to not only consuming but creating visual content everyday through apps like Instagram and Snapchat, Facebook and Twitter. We tell our daily stories, expressing who we are by documenting and sharing our experiences visually.</p>
      
      <h5><strong>The artistic side pf photography</strong></h5>
      
      <p>First and foremost, artistic photography has to be transformational, not merely representational. While you might happen to capture an incredible scene on your way to work, your photo can’t be considered art unless it has been changed in some way by your intelligence and thought process. However, this doesn’t mean that artistic photography can only be achieved with complex staging and lighting or digital effects; in fact, some of the most artistic photos ever taken have been landscapes – for example, the work of Ansel Adams.

This is because the artistic transformation is more subtle than most people understand. You can apply an artistic filter to any photograph via the following:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Framing: Simply by choosing to frame or crop the scene in a certain way, you can elevate a photograph to the status of art. Alfred Stieglitz’s famous photograph The Steerage (1907) is often considered the first important artistic photograph ever taken. While it could be seen as purely representational, Stieglitz’s decisions in framing, in what to include in the scene, and linking the various shapes and lines that naturally occurred before him were actually transformational, resulting in a photograph that is true art.</li><br>
        <li>Film choice: In the modern age the choice of film stock, color versus black and white, and other technical decisions can act as an artistic filter, transforming a scene even if no other staging or technical alterations are made to it.</li><br>
        <li>Positioning: Representational photography must simply take in the scene it comes across. However the scene can be elevated simply by making the decision to shoot the photo from a specific angle, a specific vantage point, and at a specific point in time.</li><br>
      </ul>
        
        
    
      <h4><strong>Great principles of photography</strong></h4>
      <p>The 7 principles of art and design are balance, rhythm, pattern, emphasis, contrast, unity and movement. Use the elements of art and design – line, shape/form, space, value, color and texture – to create a composition as a whole.

The elements of art and design are the tools of visual artists. The principles of art and design represent how an artist uses these tools to create visual art.

By applying the 7 principles of art and design, photographers can create a cohesive image grounded in the foundations of art theory.</p>
     
      
      <ul>
        <li>It has a lot of  elements</li><br>
        <li>It works as a visual</li><br>
        <li>It needs to be very cohesive</li>
        <li>The light and shadows that are created</li>
    
      </ul>
   <p>Also if you are a passionate about photography, here are some tips for capturing light and shadows in your projects and how we can look and understand the object that it is photographed.
If you keep your eyes open, you’ll find plenty of great opportunities to include shadows in your images.

<p>The dramatic lighting after a storm, or the soft early morning or late afternoon light are all great opportunities to capture beautiful shadows in your compositions. Keep in mind that <strong>when the sun is closer to the horizon, the shadows will be longer</strong>. In the same way, if you are photographing indoors using a lamp or an off-camera flash, the closer your light source is to the surface, the longer the shadow will be.</p>

<p>When capturing shadows, it’s a good idea to use your camera in manual mode. This will give you more control over the exposure, and the resulting images. If you use automatic mode, there’s a good chance that your shadows will come out too light.</p>

<p>You’ll also want to use your camera’s <strong>LCD screen or histogram</strong> to make sure the image is properly exposed. If it’s not, you can always use exposure value (EV) compensation to adjust it. If you see that a shot is too bright, dial the exposure down to deepen the shadows.</p>

<p>While light is a vital part of photography, <strong>the absence of light is also important</strong>. Paying attention to available light, and learning to manipulate it or work with it to intentionally create highlights and lowlights in your images will help you to capture interesting and varied photos drama, depth, and lots of visual interest.</p>
